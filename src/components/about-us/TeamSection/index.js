    description: `I joined the Australian Army in 1991 starting in Infantry
      and experienced various other sectors during my service. After my service commitment, I completed my service and
      pursued the establishment of my own business. In 2005 SecureCash was born. With a keen insight into what can be
      improved in this industry and a philosophy of looking outside the square, I have brought together a team which is
      able to provide our clientele with a superior standard of service, whilst I oversee major developments in
      processes and integrating technology in the deliverance of service to our customers.`,

    description: `I initially undertook hospitality studies whilst working in that field. It was through this
      industry that a love of providing excellent customer service was born. I transitioned to international freight
      forwarding by providing customer service to key accounts. I also undertook a sea export role by managing the
      collection and shipment of international wine for sea freight export. This role gave me valuable insights into
      logistics. I joined Darren in 2009 to initially provide accounting and customer service support, but as our
      business has grown, so has my responsibility to now take on the role of general manager for SecureCash.`,

      areas of Adelaide. Previously working in Valuation Services at the Department of Lands, I took time after
      returning to University to homeschool my middle child. My two eldest are on the Autism Spectrum and the youngest
      has Cerebral Palsy, so any spare time goes into therapy and appointments. With three children, home life is never
      quiet or boring. In fact, we all game together on a regular basis. So, if you need help, or want my Blizzard or
      Riot username, let me know!`,

    description: `Tough tattooed exterior, yet goes home to play Pokemon. Clearly the brains of SecureCash, I joined the
      company in 2018 one week after I married my best friend, Demi. I initially started doing outgoing sales but have
      since developed my skills to specialise in Team Management, IT, Design, and the Marketing for SecureCash. My
      passion is for animals, so I just imagine the rest of the team has four legs and fur to be able to put up with
      them all day. Anything technology and design-related piques my interest, with a passion for creating something
      from scratch. The only time youâ€™ll hear my name called across the office is if somebody "breaks" their computer.`,
