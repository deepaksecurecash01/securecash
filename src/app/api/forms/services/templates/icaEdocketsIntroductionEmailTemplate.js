                                    <p>We have created an electronic docket application called eDockets and it's available for your business to use!</p>
                                    <p>We wanted to make our processes easier for both our customers and contractors while keeping things relevant and simple!</p>
                                    <p>SecureCash are a licensed reseller for our application and they want you to receive the same benefits they have from operating with this system.</p>
                                    <p>The process is simple, you turn up to the customers business, scan a couple of barcodes, get a signature and you're out. An email will be generated for record keeping and sent straight to both parties. When depositing the banking all you need to do is select the customers banking on the app and submit the docket. Again an email is generated and sent to both parties.</p>
                                    <p>That's the basics, but of course there is a tonne more features and even more to come. It's an application which will be constantly in development and regularly maintained. We are always looking for ways to improve and feedback is always welcome.</p>
                                    <p>It can also be linked to an online portal which can store all records, be modified to each user and gives the customer the ability to tailor their services. They can book collections, cancel collections and even order change, notifying you of everything and making the whole process easier for both parties.</p>
                                    <p>We'd love to show more or set up a demo for you, just let us know by replying to this email.</p>
