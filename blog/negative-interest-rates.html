                <article class="blog-content-wrap">
                    <p></p>
                    <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Recently the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announced an
                            interest rate drop. Even if you do not own stocks and shares, if you do not earn millions
                            each year, this still has an effect on you. If we run into negative rates, you may have to
                            pay the bank to store your money.</strong></p>
                    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Interest rates and what they are there for.</h3>
                    <p>Banks serve multiple purposes. You can store your money there, or save, and you can take out a
                        loan, or borrow. Both of these are not free for both parties. To store your money in the bank,
                        and save it, the bank will pay you a &ldquo;fee&rdquo;. A percentage of your money is calculated
                        and paid back to you regularly. This is your interest that you earn on savings.</p>
                    <p>This money that is stored in the bank, is used to fund loans. If someone takes out a loan (to
                        build a house, buy a car, or whatever), they are given the money and have to pay it back to the
                        bank, along with the &ldquo;fee&rdquo; involved. The cost of borrowing this money is the
                        interest calculated on the amount borrowed (the principal).</p>
                    <p><strong><a target="_blank"
                                href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-are-interest-rates-and-how-do-they-work-3305855"
                                rel="noopener">https://www.thebalance.com/what-are-interest-rates-and-how-do-they-work-3305855</a></strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>With me so far? Pretty easy steps to here: save money and be rewarded, or borrow money and pay
                        for that privilege.</p>
                    <h3 style="text-align:center;">High versus Low Interest Rates</h3>
                    <p>When interest rates are high it will have an effect on what people do with their money. People
                        who save money in the bank will earn more interest on their deposits. People who take out a
                        loan, will have to pay more in return. Less loans are taken out in this instance as the amount
                        repayable is too expensive and they cannot justify the repayment amount. However, more people
                        save money as they will be earning more from their bank.</p>
                    <p>When interest rates are low, it stands to reason the opposite happens. People tend to take out
                        more loans to begin businesses or build houses. The amount repaid is so low, more people can
                        afford the repayment total. Savings earn less interest though, so people may not keep their
                        money in the bank, but rather might spend more and have cash on hand.</p>
                    <p>Still with me? It&rsquo;s still relatively black and white. We&rsquo;re about to go grey.</p>
                    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Negative interest rates</h3>
                    <p>This will have the effect on the banking industry of reversing everything I just said.</p>
                    <p>A negative interest rate means that when you have any savings in your bank, you have to pay them
                        to store the funds. If you borrow money, the bank will end up paying you, in a way.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>If you are used to having all your funds in your account and swiping or paying electronically
                        everywhere you go, not only will you be paying the transaction fees for each usage, you may end
                        up paying to store the money in the first place. So you will end up paying the bank twice to use
                        your own income.</p>

                </article>
                <article class="blog-content-wrap">
                    <p class="blog-content-wrap">However if you borrow funds, again for whatever purpose - building,
                        car, holiday) your lower interest rate might mean that when you perhaps borrow $200000 to build
                        a house, you might only repay $170000 of it.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="blog-content-wrap"><strong><a target="&rdquo;_blank&rdquo;"
                                href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-31/interest-rate-cut-to-negative-territory/12832066">https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-31/interest-rate-cut-to-negative-territory/12832066</a></strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-content-wrap">Now if this does happen, there are consequences. If people are not
                        leaving their money in the bank (remember right back at the beginning? That money is what is
                        used to fund loans), there is no money made on the lending, and as it costs the banks so much
                        (billions), it would be better not to lend out money at all. We end up with no one building
                        houses, no one buying cars.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content-wrap">People also become wary of spending at all. A hoarding mentality sets
                        in and people prefer to keep cash on hand rather than fork it over. The uncertainty from stable,
                        reliable banks flipping their purposes leads to a concern over savings and ability to retire
                        comfortably.&nbsp; However, if you are not overly concerned with saving, you are now free to
                        spend your money on what you need, without having to pay the bank higher fees to store your
                        income.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content-wrap"><strong><a target="&rdquo;_blank&rdquo;"
                                href="https://www.savings.com.au/home-loans/how-would-negative-interest-rates-work-in-australia">https://www.savings.com.au/home-loans/how-would-negative-interest-rates-work-in-australia</a></strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-content-wrap">There are a few countries that are experimenting with negative interest
                        rates to boost their economies. Switzerland, Denmark and Japan all have negative interest rates
                        set by their Central Banks. The fees in Switzerland, if nowhere else, were not passed onto their
                        customers, and banks had to absorb the cost of housing funds.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="blog-content-wrap">Banks themselves have to borrow money from the Central Bank in their
                        country. So in Australia, that is the Reserve Bank. This is why their interest rate setting
                        matters. They say how much the smaller banks have to pay to store money in the larger bank. Then
                        the smaller banks charge a similar amount to us, their customers. But that can send us off on
                        another tangent and we&rsquo;ve already covered a lot for today.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content-wrap">If you have not had to delve into interest rates before, I hope this
                        explains a lot and clears up some terminology for you. If you already know about them, thanks
                        for reading. It looks like it will be an interesting time in banking.</p>
