                    <p>Banking institutions have a long past, and there are options. You do not have to use a
                        &ldquo;bank&rdquo; but perhaps might prefer a credit union. What is the difference?</p>
                    <p>Banks originated as <strong>Merchant Banks</strong> and were invented by grain and cloth
                        merchants in the Middle Ages. It became increasingly necessary to have to store valuables,
                        whether they were assets or tradable goods, in a secure location to be &ldquo;withdrawn&rdquo;
                        later. Eventually money could be lent to someone based on the premise their crop would yield the
                        similar amount next harvest. Currently, these have evolved into Investment Banks or Accepting
                        and Issuing Houses and usually manage portfolios, or investment concerns and merger/acquisition
                        counsel.</p>

                    <p><strong>Commercial Banks</strong> are the kind we are most used to seeing. They provide general
                        services to the public, including savings accounts and loans. They can issue and clear cheques,
                        perhaps provide safe deposit boxes, maybe offer credit or debit cards, and deal in foreign
                        exchange transactions.</p>
                    <p>Commercial Banks will also have members of the public as customers as well as corporations. These
                        are primarily the major banks in any region and are regulated by the country&rsquo;s Central
                        Bank, or Reserve Bank.</p>
                    <p><strong>Central Banks</strong>, Reserve Banks, or Monetary Authority oversee a country&rsquo;s
                        banking system. They manage the money for their nations, whether through policies or setting
                        interest rates, by regulating the Commercial Banks, and much more. These are the banks that will
                        be able to lend money to governments, and other banks, as well as managing gold reserves and
                        control the money supply for the country.</p>

                    <p>The Amsterdamsche Wisselbank in 1609, was a forerunner to Central Banks was able to receive
                        foreign and local money, deducted their fees, and credited the customer with the balance in
                        their books. This was bank money and was safe from fire or robbery as it was secured by the
                        city, and it could be transferred to another person. The Bank of Amsterdam gave receipts for
                        gold and silver bullion stored, and charged a nominal fee for this rental of bank space.</p>

                    <p><strong>A Building Society</strong> is owned by its members, and began as far back as the 18th
                        Century. Birmingham was growing rapidly and a group was formed (Ketley&rsquo;s Building Society)
                        whereby members would pay monthly into a central fund which was then used to finance building
                        houses for members. This in turn was used as collateral to enable more funds to be obtained,
                        giving the members the ability to build more houses. These were based in taverns mostly, and
                        Ketley&rsquo;s in particular was formed in 1775.</p>
                    <p><strong>Mutual Savings Banks</strong> emerged at a similar time, and was again owned by its
                        members who paid into a central fund. In 1810 the Savings and Friendly Society was founded by
                        Reverend Duncan in Scotland. His primary motivation was to encourage his congregation to become
                        thrifty and save money.</p>

                    <p><strong>Credit Unions</strong> are not only owned by its members, and they vote for the head of
                        their bank, but the members must share a common bond. They may belong to a similar location,
                        employer, or profession. These not for profit institutions originally served poorer people,
                        middle class workers and sometimes urban and rural communities.</p>

                    <p>Beginning in Germany in the 1850s, and were based on the cooperative movement that was finding
                        success in other markets. Some had begun as a way to feed families that might not have been able
                        to afford without assistance. Mostly they have evolved into establishments worldwide that are
                        more resilient in the face of adversity , whether hurricanes or financial collapses. In Japan in
                        the 19th Century village unions were able to lend money with all members bearing the cost in
                        case of default. While Japan operated under Sakoku, and was isolated from the rest of the world,
                        the invention of a cooperative was not influenced by other countries or established practices
                        overseas. The ability to form groups that helped each other strive seems to be inherent and
                        universal.</p>

                    <p>The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund were created in 1944. After World War II the
                        Bretton Woods system established rules for financial relations between the US, Canada,
                        Australia, most of Europe and Japan. These led to commercial banks lending to third world
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>World Bank</strong> provides loans to low and middle income countries that may want
                        to fund advancements, and is actually the World Bank Group, comprised of five international
                        organisations</p>
                    <p>The <strong>International Monetary Fund</strong> consists of 189 countries working together to
                        reduce poverty and secure financial stability. They also operate on a type of cooperative system
                        where countries can borrow against funds that are pooled by all member countries.</p>
                    <p>So there we have it, there&rsquo;s your bank where you can pop in and cash a cheque, and
                        there&rsquo;s a heap more! You can now tell the difference between all types of banks, and
                        perhaps it may make you rethink which type you give your business to.</p>
