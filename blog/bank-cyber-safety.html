            Long gone are the days where most of us were distrustful of internet
            or phone banking. Originally seen as risky, many of us now think
            nothing of paying via tap-and-go, BPay or PayPal. Electronic banking
            has become the go-to convenience for so many people, too busy in
            their day-to-day lives to manage a trip to pay bills directly
            anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            But did you have any idea how often these databases and storage
            facilities were breached?! At a cursory search, Wikipedia showed me
            a listing of all hacks and breaches. Whether it was an intentional
            inside leak, or hacking, from data being sold to a third party, or
            just negligence and accidentally publishing client&rsquo;s details.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the most outstanding mentions were the Bank of America,
            NASDAQ, the IRS, American Express, and Citigroup.

            The numbers of records exposed is quite concerning. And the table
            above just shows select banking breaches. There were entire
            Government sites infiltrated. If they contained personal banking
            information on the population, that would also contribute to the
            banking data spewed out. Airlines and hotels with booking
            confirmations and bank account details, even if saved temporarily
            until your flight or hotel stay, are still vulnerable during that
            time out of your hands.

            All it took for Chile was for one employee to click on a link in a
            spam email. The malicious file sent via an Office document, opened a
            backdoor into the banks network resulting in all branches of the
            country's largest three banks shutting down completely. This was not
            long after Chile&rsquo;s network was breached in an attempt to
            completely disrupt the nation&rsquo;s banking.

            Bank hit the nation hard in 2016. Soon after, Russia confirmed

            The Boston Consulting Group found financial firms were 300 times

            reporting in 2019 that there were over 460 000 attempts to breach

            This report highlighted the ability of banks and financial
            institutions to detect and contain a cyber attack rather than
            prevent them in the first place.

            to Covid-19 has a majority of the world&rsquo;s population sticking
            to electronic options, attempts to breach networks have intensified.

            A year ago the Big 4 in Australia were compromised. Banking details
            linked to PayID were all breached. Westpac did not even realise this
            breach had occurred until another institution contacted them. Once a
            second party realised what was happening, they alerted the bank, who
            only then could investigate and begin securing customer&rsquo;s
            funds.

            And the NAB specifically reported being hit by millions of cyber
            attacks per day. The increase of attacks by 78% mid year led to 33%
            more losses being reported. The claim in the NAB report was also
            that some of the cyber crime was state-sponsored as well, just to
            obtain information on Australians.

            However they also showed syndicates attempting to slow down
            bank&rsquo;s systems to gain financial information. We won&rsquo;t
            go into DDoS attacks and what they can do to systems. But large
            scale attacks can slow processing speeds so far that transactions in
            and out of account will come to a standstill.

            Back in May a report showed ransomware attacks against banks had
            increased nine-fold earlier in 2020. It reported attacks on banks
            had actually spiked 238%. 238! Quite a few of the respondents also
            reported the attacks had become much more sophisticated over the
            past 12 months, with many reporting an attack that was designed
            purely to elicit damage, rather than obtain any ransom money.

            In fact, an interview with hacker Phineas Phisher revealed he
            &ldquo;lived&rdquo; in banks networks for months before being
            detected. Phineas is a private individual whose anti-capitalist,
            anti-surveillance views prompted him to hack the Italian IT company
            Hacking Team, as well as Anglo-German company Gamma Group. These
            corporations sell software to enable governments to gather data and
            information on, and from, their citizens.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most worrying part of the interview was that Phineas did not use
            any sophisticated tools, only off-the-shelf crimeware. The
            investigation into the Cayman National Isle of Man Bank found a
            breach that Phineas claimed was not actually his. His claim was that
            it was a coincidence, and that someone else was simultaneously
            hacking the bank. The less sophisticated and experienced criminal
            was exposed, revealing the Phineas Phisher hack from months prior.

            What we can all learn from this is that there are large corporations
            out there, supplying software to countries so they can surveil their
            own inhabitants as well as other countries, AND that competent
            hackers don&rsquo;t even need that type of software to be able to
            hack into our data.

            So while I am not advocating the mass withdrawal of cash that is
            prompting countries to have shortages of notes, perhaps keep in the
            back of your mind that electronically speaking, our money is not
            entirely safe either. We may be looking at governments preferring a
            cashless society, but is that going to be safe enough? Is there
            going to be a guarantee that my hard earned income is only
            accessible by me? Cyber security is becoming a much larger field. I
            think perhaps an extremely necessary one. And could it lead to
            individuals having to hire their own cyber consultants before
