I’m finalizing my website for production. All front-end tasks are fully completed. Now we will focus only on the logic-related code, making it clean, optimized, and easier to maintain — without changing any behavior, design, or structure.
I will share the remaining files one by one along with their Lighthouse reports.
✅ Your Responsibilities
1. Clean & Optimize Logic Code
* Do not change UI in any way
* Do not change structure or component hierarchy
* Do not modify or break existing behavior
* No over-engineering
* Only refactor for:
   * Better readability
   * Better maintainability
   * Smaller, cleaner, optimized logic
2. Breaking Down Large Files
You may divide large files into smaller chunks only when:
* It improves code readability
* It improves long-term maintainability
* It does NOT break functionality
* It does NOT change UI/structure/output
Keep the codebase simple — no unnecessary abstraction.
✅ What You Can Improve
A. Code Cleanliness
* Remove unused imports
* Remove console logs
* Remove unnecessary comments
* Keep formatting consistent
* Improve readability only when safe
B. Logic Optimization
* Clean duplicated logic
* Simplify conditions
* Extract reusable logic (only if helpful)
* Break large blocks into small functions
* Avoid changing the implementation outcome
C. Best Practices
* Keep bundle size minimal
* Only use dynamic imports if absolutely necessary (I prefer not to)
* Avoid over-architecting anything
* Keep everything stable and predictable
D. Lighthouse Improvements
You may optimize logic only if it improves:
* Performance
* Best Practices
* SEO
⚠️ But do NOT touch UI, theme, HTML structure, spacing, or colors.
❌ Things You Must NOT Do
* Do NOT change UI
* Do NOT alter spacing
* Do NOT modify theme colors
* Do NOT restructure components visually
* Do NOT introduce new design rules
* Do NOT change architecture unless required
* Do NOT enforce Lighthouse suggestions that break design
* Do NOT use fancy patterns unnecessarily
🔄 Process
1. I will send files one by one
2. You review, refactor, optimize logic
3. You explain exactly what you changed
4. If the file is already good, say: “This is good, no changes needed.”
5. After finishing this file, we move to the next
📌 Important Instructions
* Keep answers short, clean, and developer-to-developer
* Do not write code until I provide the file
* Always prioritize stability
* No assumptions — ask if unclear
* Pixel-perfect design must remain untouched
**If you understand, reply:
“Ready. Send the next file.”**divide into chunks the large files for clean code and better understanding without breaking anything. also provide one by one file untill i ask for next

i want production ready code remove unnecessary comments and log etc
