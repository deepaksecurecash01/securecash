                <h4>How Much Notice?</h4>
                <p><b>How Early Should I Request for Cash Delivery So It Would Reach My Location On
                    Time?</b>&nbsp;<br><br>Please process your cash delivery request as early as 2
                  business days. A 2-day notice will allow your bank to arrange your funds. It also
                  gives us more time to assess potential disruptions to obtain a much smoother cash
                  delivery flow during the requested date.<br><br></p>

                <p><b>What Happens If the Cash You Deliver is Less Than What I
                    Ordered?</b>&nbsp;<br><br>We only collect the money that is sealed in your
                  bank&rsquo;s tamper-evident satchels. If a shortfall may occur, we can easily trace
                  it back to the issuing bank. Once we can verify the problem, you can contact them
                  and they will be happy to reimburse you accordingly.<br><br></p>
