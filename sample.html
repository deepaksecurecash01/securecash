                <p><b>How will I know that my funds were successfully deposited in the bank?</b>&nbsp;<br><br>After the
                  deposit, our banking courier will obtain the cashier&rsquo;s receipt which will be uploaded on our
                  eDocket app (the leading software application that&rsquo;s unique to <strong>SecureCash</strong>). The
                  eDocket will generate a digital docket which can be forwarded to you. Real-time updates and
                  notifications regarding the deposit will be sent to you via email.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Contract?</h4>
                <p><b>Tell me more about your contract. How long are we locked-in for?</b>&nbsp;<br><br>The great thing
                  about <strong>SecureCash</strong> is we do not let our clients sign lengthy lock-in contracts. The
                  only thing we ask from you is to tell us if there are problems with our service. We want our customers

                <h4>Insured?</h4>
                <p><b>Is my money insured during the transport process?</b>&nbsp;<br><br>Yes, our cash-in-transit
                  service is covered by a nationwide CIT insurance policy. This ensures that your funds are safe from
                  the time it leaves your premises up to the time it reaches your bank.</p>
