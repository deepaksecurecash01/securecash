                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        We have been operating in the security industry for over 25 years,
                        since 1992 to be exact. In 2005, we made the decision to overhaul
                        our business model and concentrate solely on Cash in Transit,
                        starting the beginning of the SecureCash era.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We made this decision so that we could specialise in one section of
                        the security industry and give our complete attention to provide the
                        best possible service for our customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We strive to constantly evolve and bring innovative solutions to
                        develop our company and make our service experience the best it can
                        be for our customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to your hard earned money you need someone you can
                        trust and rely upon to handle the banking for your business. We take
                        this very seriously and work very hard from our end to ensure all of
                        our systems and protocols can provide that assurance.

                </div>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p style="text-align: left">
                        Many people perceive armed security officers favorably as a
                        deterrent against violence and an assurance that a violent incident
                        can be quickly quelled. From a client&rsquo;s standpoint, it offers
                        a perception of higher protection.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left">
                        Armed security officers are widely accepted as warranted in certain
                        locations where the threat level matches the use of force.
                        Government contracts and high-profile corporate executives are
                        protected by highly trained armed officers. At banks, the risk of
                        robbery also justifies an armed officer.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left">
                        But it is difficult to craft a convincing argument for armed
                        security officers in many settings. The presence of a gun is not
                        proven to de-escalate a situation in every environment, and it is
                        unlikely to deter violent and determined individuals. The presence
                        of an additional firearm &mdash; even in a security officer&rsquo;s
                        hands &mdash; only stands to increase the risk of casualties. This
                        is particularly true of public or crowded environments, like
                        stadiums, schools, and restaurants.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left">
                        By looking at insurance claims, it&rsquo;s clear that when a
                        security officer discharges his or her gun, the resulting claims are
                        serious. Claims resulting from the use of firearms are likely to
                        breach insurance policy limits, so firms employing armed security
                        officers are wise to purchase higher limits of liability than firms
                        not employing armed officers.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left">
                        When someone is shot by a security officer, his &mdash; or his
                        estate &mdash; will likely sue the business that contracted the
                        officer. And the security firm and officer are going to be brought
                        into the suit as well&mdash;no matter how well-trained the officer.
                        If it goes to trial, it is very rare for a judge and jury to believe
                        use of the weapon was justified. It is almost always perceived as
                        excessive force.
                    </p>

                        This is why SecureCash operates unarmed and in plain clothes, but
                        still with all bank couriers trained in the necessary high level
                        risk training. We will be in and out of your business without
                        alerting any unwanted attention, banking your money on the day we
                        collect.

                                    I initially undertook hospitality studies whilst working in
                                    that field. It was through this industry that a love of
                                    providing excellent customer service was born. I transitioned
                                    to international freight forwarding by providing customer
                                    service to key accounts. I also undertook a sea export role by
                                    managing the collection and shipment of international wine for
                                    sea freight export. This role gave me valuable insights into
                                    logistics. I joined Darren in 2009 to initially provide
                                    accounting and customer service support, but as our business
                                    has grown, so has my responsibilities to now take on the role
                                    of general manager for SecureCash.

                                    for 4000 players in the northern areas of Adelaide. Previously

                                    took time after returning to University to homeschool my
                                    middle child. My two eldest are on the Autism Spectrum and the
                                    youngest has Cerebral Palsy, so any spare time goes into
                                    therapy and appointments. With three children, home life is
                                    never quiet or boring. In fact we all game together on a

                                    Clearly the brains of SecureCash, I joined the company in 2018
                                    one week after I married my best friend, Demi. I initially
                                    started doing outgoing sales but have since developed my
                                    skills to specialise in Team Management, IT, Design and the
                                    Marketing for SecureCash. My passion is for animals, so I just
                                    imagine the rest of the team has four legs and fur to be able
                                    to put up with them all day. Anything technology and design
                                    related peaks my interest, with a passion for creating
                                    something from scratch. The only time you&rsquo;ll hear my
                                    name called across the office is if somebody
                                    &ldquo;breaks&rdquo; their computer.

                                the brains of SecureCash, I joined the company in 2018 one week
                                after I married my best friend, Demi. I initially started doing
                                outgoing sales but have since developed my skills to specialise
                                in Team Management, IT, Design and the Marketing for SecureCash.
                                My passion is for animals, so I just imagine the rest of the
                                team has four legs and fur to be able to put up with them all
